        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Encapsulation:\n",
        "   \n",
        "   This concept involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also involves restricting access to some of the object's components, which is often done by using access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public`. This helps in protecting the object's internal state and prevents unauthorized access.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Abstraction:\n",
        "   \n",
        "    Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows users to interact with objects at a higher level without needing to understand the intricate workings inside. This is typically achieved using abstract classes and interfaces, which provide a blueprint for other classes to implement.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Inheritance:\n",
        "   \n",
        "    Inheritance allows one class (child or subclass) to inherit the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between the parent and child classes, allowing the child class to extend or modify the inherited behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Polymorphism:\n",
        "   \n",
        "    Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, even if they are actually instances of subclasses. The most common use of polymorphism is through method overriding (where a subclass provides its own version of a method defined in the superclass) and method overloading (where multiple methods with the same name can exist with different parameters).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Composition (often considered as the fifth key concept):\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Composition refers to a design principle where an object is composed of other objects, rather than inheriting from them. It is a way of building complex objects by combining simpler objects, promoting greater flexibility and reducing the tight coupling seen in inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "These five principles together help create software that is modular, reusable, and easier to maintain."

        "Python does not natively support method overloading in the same way as some other languages like Java or C++. However, Python allows method overloading-like behavior by using default arguments or variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs). This gives flexibility in how methods can be defined and called, effectively mimicking overloading.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Approach 1: Using Default Arguments\n",

        "\n",
        "Approach 2: Using Variable-Length Arguments (*args)\n",
        "If you need more flexibility, you can use *args to handle an arbitrary number of arguments.\n",

        "Approach 3: Using @staticmethod with Different Signatures\n",

These approaches help achieve similar functionality."

        "In Python, inheritance allows one class (child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent or superclass). Python supports several types of inheritance, which can be combined in various ways. Here are the five types of inheritance in Python:\n",

        "1. Single Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "One class inherits from another, gaining access to its methods and attributes.\n",

        "2. Multiple Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In multiple inheritance, a subclass inherits from more than one superclass. This allows the subclass to inherit methods and attributes from all its parent classes.\n",
